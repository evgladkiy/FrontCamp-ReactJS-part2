## ReactJS App part 1

### Rate Criterias:

Create simple client blog application (e.g. like Twitter). It should have the ability to add/delete post, show all posts and filter them by authors.

Task 1:

1)	Set up dev environment
2)	Create all the markup with react;
3)	Add the ability to add new post;
4)	Add the ability to filter posts;
5)	Implement Server-Side rendering;

All posts data could be stored in the state of the app, but If this task would be too easy for you, you can connect your application to the Node.js server from the previous task (because this step would be necessary in the second home task).
